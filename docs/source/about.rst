What is the NBO-Q Microscopy Glossary?
======================================
**The NBO-Q Microscopy Gloasary collects shared definitions for hardware components, acquisition settings and calibrtion metrics that are collected and developed by QUAREP-LiMi.**

The NBO-Q Microscopy Glossary collects shared definitions for Microscopy Hardware, Imaging Acquisition Settings, and Quality Control merics that are developed in the context of QUAREP-LiMi and in close collaboration with the `4D Nucleome (4DN) initiative <https://www.4dnucleome.org/>`_ , the `Bioimaging North America <https://www.bioimagingnorthamerica.org/>`_ `Quality Control and Data Management Working Group <https://www.bioimagingnorthamerica.org/qc-dm-wg/>`_, the Open Microscopy Environment initiative and other national and international bioimaging initiative. 

This Microscopy Gloasary is built to extend and augment the recetnly published `4DN-BINA-OME (NBO) Microscopy Metadata Specifications <https://github.com/WU-BIMAC/NBOMicroscopyMetadataSpecs/tree/master/Model/stable%20version/v02-01>`_ and the `OME data model <https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/ome-model/5.6.1/developers/model-overview.html>`_.
