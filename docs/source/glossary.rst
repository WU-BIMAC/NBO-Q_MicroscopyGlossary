Microscopy Glossary
===================
The NBO-Q Microscopy Glossary organized in sections, that are organized on the basis of the `4DN-BINA-OME (NBO) Microscopy Metadata Specifications <https://github.com/WU-BIMAC/NBOMicroscopyMetadataSpecs/tree/master/Model/stable%20version/v02-01>`_. In addition to a section that describes the microscope **Instrument** as a whole and a section that contain **Manufacturer Specifications** terms that are common to all hardware components (e.g., Manufacturer, Brand, Model, Catalog Number), there is a section for each of the **individual hardware components** that comprise a modern microscope Instrument. 

All sections that have been developed so far or are in progress are listed below:
