Type,,"The general category to which this Microscope belongs. Options include a Compound Microscope is a Microscope in which the primary image is generated by an objective or an objective and a tube-lens, and in which the Sample is observed through an eyepiece. A Custom Microscope is specially designed for specialized purposes. An Electrophysiology Microscope is a Microscope dedicated to electrophysiological observation and manipulation. A Lightsheet Microscope is a Microscope in which in contrast to epifluorescence microscopy only a thin slice (usually a few hundred nanometers to a few micrometers) of the sample is illuminated perpendicularly to the direction of observation. A Stereo Microscope (also known as Dissecting Microscope) is a low-power, binocular Microscope with long free working distance used for dissecting. Generally in this type of Microscope the object is observed by each eye from a slightly different angle, thus causing stereoscopic perception.
