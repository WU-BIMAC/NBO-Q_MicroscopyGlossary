Welcome to the 4DN-BINA-OME-QUAREP Microscopy Glossary
======================================================
This repository contains a Microscopy Gloasary developed in the context of `QUAlity and REProducibility for Instruments and Images in Light Microscopy (QUAREP-LiMi). <https://quarep.org/>`_

This Glossary is based on the `4DN-BINA-OME (NBO) Microscopy Metadata Specifications <https://github.com/WU-BIMAC/NBOMicroscopyMetadataSpecs/tree/master/Model/stable%20version/v02-01>`_ which was recently published on a Nature Methos FOCUS issue on Reporting and Reproducibility in Microscopy.

The NBO Microscopy Metadata Specifications are a suite of scalable an extensions of the `OME data model <https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/ome-model/5.6.1/developers/model-overview.html>`_ thare being continually developed in the context of the `4D Nucleome (4DN) initiative <https://www.4dnucleome.org/>`_ and the `Bioimaging North America <https://www.bioimagingna.org>`_ `Quality Control and Data Management Working Group <https://www.bioimagingna.org/qc-dm-wg>`_ and `QUAREP-LiMi <https://quarep.org/>`_
